# NetworkAttackClassification
Network Attack Classification using Deep Learning 
>> This project is basically based on the classification of different newtork attack using the deep learning techniques like cnn and other algorithms.
>> here we are using the heat map and other concepts of confusion matrix to create a image matrix which will be the input for our cnn technique.
